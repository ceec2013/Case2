1. Create database OMS in postgresql
2. Restore database filename OMSCDB.sql
3. Add trader on the db : Trader type indicates the level of the user. 0(zero) is Admin level and 1(one) is regular user level
4. Run Main exe in \case 2\Scripts\dist
5. enter database server username and password
6. run the delphi OMSC (close the TMS screen sorry using free trial on my personal computer.)
7. enter username password


I'm sorry I didn't manage to finish the case as I had a flu in the past week as well as internet issues and only managed to have my internet back today.
